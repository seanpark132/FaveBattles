# FaveBattles
https://favebattles.netlify.app/

A single-page app where users can create and play tournament-like games to test their preferences on trendy topics such as food, TV shows, and music.
Users can discover popular choices for topics they are interested in, play with friends to see where opinions differ, and look at the rankings to see
where their favourite lands in comparison to other users' favourites. 

# How a game works:
For example, a game might be on fast-food restaurants, with a pool of 16 popular chains. After starting the game, the app will randomly generate a tournament
bracket of 8 rounds, each with 2 of the choices from the pool. For each round, the website will display the two choices, and their images/videos. The user needs to click
the choice they prefer over the other and want to send to the next bracket of rounds. The winner of the final round (first place) will be their favourite! 

# How to create your own game: 
You can create your own game on FaveBattles to share with other users and/or friends!\
To create a game, click the "Create a new game" button at the top of the website. There are 2 options: images and youtube videos. 

*1. Create a game with images*\
For each choice in your game, upload an image from your device. After uploading, the page will display the image and it's name. 

*2. Create a game with Youtube videos*\
For each choice in your game, copy the URL of a Youtbe video, paste it into the "Video URL" input box, and then click "Add video". If you want the video to start at a certain time instead of 0:00, enter the start time as well. 

For each of the choices, the names can be edited. Set the title, categories, and description of your game and click the "Create Game!" button at the bottom to create the game.
A game must have minimum of 4 choices. It is recommended to have the number of choices be an exponent of 2 (4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc). 


# Rankings Page
Each game has a rankings page with the win percents of each choice. The choices are ranked based on their game winning percent (% of games the choice got first place), and 
then on their round winning percent (% of rounds the choice won). These statistics are taken as users play the game.
